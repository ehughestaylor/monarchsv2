                <h3 class="center-align" style="font-family:mainFont; margin-top:0;"><strong style="color:white;">Day 4</strong><br>Richmond, Virginia</h3>

                <p>After winning 14-3 yesterday we felt good about ourselves. When we arrived at the hotel today we had a group of people waiting outside to welcome us.  That was really cool. The team that we would be play today was in the same hotel as us yesterday.  We got to hangout with the other team.  They were all fun to hang around, but once game time came around, it was game time. </p> 

                <p>We had to pack our bags and go to the next city, but before we left Virginia we played a game at RF&P Park.  It might have been one of the best fields I ever played on.  They had enough seats for a couple hundred people and they had an awesome Trolley car in left field.  </p>

                <p>Before the game started they announced our names and played the 'Star Spangled Banner'.  Then game on, we were batting first.  We put up four runs in the first inning.  In the second we scored 3, 6 in the fourth, 3 in the fifth and 3 in the 6th.  The team had a great performance, everybody was hitting the ball.  I went 4-4 at the plate, Tamir hit a bomb off of the wall and the rest of the lineup made great contact as well. After the game we took pictures with the other team and said our goodbyes.  </p>

                <p>Then we were on our way to the USA Baseball Academy.  Traffic was running smooth, that was nice.  Once we arrived to the USA baseball complex we were all amazed.  The fields were beautiful.  The director introduced himself to the team and told us about what goes on there. He said “We want the best and we search for the best”.  Thats what I like to hear, so every time I step onto the baseball field I give it everything I have because I owe it to the team. </p>

                <p>Today was a long, busy day. We began by visiting the White House.  We took a self guided tour after going through lots of security.  It wasn’t very exciting, because we were only able to see 5 rooms. Afterwards, it was very hot so we all took our suit jackets off. </p> 

                <p>We visited the Department of the Interior Building where we learned about a few murals and met Jonathan Jarvis, the Director of National Park Service.  The best part of the day was meeting Congressman John Lewis, who told us his story about the Civil Rights Movement.  He was awesome.  His stories were very moving and he is living history of that time.  All of the other leaders of that time have passed away.  It was hard to grasp that he was the one standing in front of all of the pictures of the march on the Edmund Pettus Bridge.  We had some good questions for him and he answered all of them.  I asked: During the second round of the Freedom Rides, how did it feel as a student to go against the orders of Dr. King despite his popularity and power in the movement?</p>
                <p>After that we visited the Nationals’ batting cages and game room.  We received signed baseballs and Sami got a bat from Michael A. Taylor.  The Nationals’ short stop Ian Desmond gave us all batting gloves.  The Nats were winning 2 to 1 against the Rays when it started to rain again. Once the rain delay began, we decided to leave.  Now I sit in my bed reflecting on the amazing day I had and the amazing days ahead.</p>

                <h3 class="story-title">Our Upcoming Tour</h3>

                <p style="font-size:1.3em; color:white;" class="center-align">“The farther backward you can look, the farther forward you are likely to see.” 
                ― Winston S. Churchill</p>

                <p>History teaches us where we’ve been and, in doing so, provides us with a much clearer picture of where we are, and where we’re going.  But history is always written by the winners.</p> 

                <p>I was born in 1961, which means that I was alive for a good portion of the modern Civil Rights Movement. But, for the life of me, I can’t recall it ever being discussed or even mentioned in my neighborhood or my home. The nuns in the catholic school I attended certainly never discussed  it with us. I guess it didn’t concern us - living in an all-white working class neighborhood in Northeast Philadelphia. Life was good. We put money in the collection basket every Sunday to help the poor, unfortunate people in other countries.  By ignoring what was going on in our own country, it was if it didn’t exist.  It didn’t matter to us. It wasn’t our problem. But it was.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, I didn’t understand that until I was an adult. It wasn’t until I read The Autobiography of Malcolm X that I started to realize how little I knew about the world outside my little bubble. Everything I knew (or thought I knew) about other races and religious groups was taught to me by the older kids in the neighborhood. I never questioned their knowledge.  They were older.  They knew about those things. But they didn’t.  And many of them still don’t. And this is why we find ourselves in the place we are now - in a country divided by race and blinded by hate, with little or no capacity to understand what fuels the fires in places like Ferguson and Baltimore.</p>
                <p>We must look back to see forward.  Education and dialogue has to replace hatred and blind ignorance. As with the Civil Rights Movement 50 years ago, that change has to start with our young people.  But, in order for them to carry out this important mission, we must arm them with the knowledge and understanding needed to effect positive change.</p>
                <p>This is why, every Friday evening for the past six months, I’ve sat in a cramped old locker room in the Marian Anderson Rec Center in South Philly with 14 adolescents, watching documentaries, learning about and discussing the Civil Rights Movement.  They are the 13 & 14 year-old Anderson Monarchs and they are our future.</p>
                <p>To enhance their studies, we will be boarding our authentic 1947 Flxible Clipper bus and embarking on a 23-day, 20-city, 4000-mile journey through the Deep South.  The kids will visit the actual sites where many of the historic events of the Civil Rights Movement took place.  They’ll meet people who were actively involved in the fight for civil rights and hear their stories, first-hand.  They’ll not only learn about their history, they’ll be able to touch it. It is our hope that they’ll come away with a better sense of who they are, where they came from, and where they’re going.</p>
                <p>Through their experiences and through the magic of social media, we hope to educate others, young and old, on the people, places and events from half a century go, and give them a better understanding of where we are as a nation today.  Maybe then, as Winston Churchill suggests, we’ll be able to see a brighter future.</p>
